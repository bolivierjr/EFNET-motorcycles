    <h3>What is #motorcycles?</h3>
 
    <p>
         We are an EFnet based conversation channel devoted to the discussion and pursuit of motorcycling. Owning a bike is not a prerequisite to join, but can be a side effect. This website is dedicated to the social networking and intense and meaningless mockery of life in general by those who frequent the efnet #motorcycles channel.

    <h3>How to get there?</h3>

        <a href="http://www.icechat.net">http://www.icechat.net/</a><br>
        <a href="http://xchat.org">http://xchat.org/</a><br>
        <br>
        Just download one and open it up. Some good servers for EFnet are:<br>
        irc.prison.net<br>
        efnet.xs4all.nl<br>
